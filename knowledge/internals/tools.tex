\subsection{NtObjectManager}

\href{https://github.com/googleprojectzero/sandbox-attacksurface-analysis-tools}{NtObjectManager} PowerShell module (backed by its supporting .NET managed library NtApiDotNet) is a godsend for Windows security researchers. From dealing with symbolic links, auditing RPC servers, playing tricks with the Object Manager, to just messing about with Windows, it has a myriad of applications. As one trying to improve their own auditing skills and understanding Windows internals, I am grateful for it. Right now I’ll admit that I am just touching the surface of the capability of the toolset. There are some advanced use cases that I have yet to get my head around. This post will be a step in the right direction. Before we jump into how to use NtObjectManager for RPC auditing, let’s take a short walk through the history of the RPC capabilities within NtApiDotNet.

    Get-ChildItem NtObject:\ | Sort-Object Name
    Get-ChildItem NtObject:\Dfs | Sort-Object Name
    Get-NtType

\end{verbatim}
