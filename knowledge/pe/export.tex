\section{Export section (.edata)}

The export data section, named .edata, contains information about symbols that other images can access through dynamic linking. Exported symbols are generally found in DLLs, but DLLs can also import symbols.

At the beginning of the Exports section, we have a structure of type \verb+ImageExportDirectory+ that gives the few information there is to know about this section. While other sections make a multitude of calls to other structures, VA and others, this section is rather simple to explore.
