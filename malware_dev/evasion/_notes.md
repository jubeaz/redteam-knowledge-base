# Notes

## Different between Native & Windows APIs & Syscalls

* **Syscalls**, are a fundamental mechanism for communication between user-level programs and the operating system. They provide an interface for applications to request services from the operating system kernel, such as file operations, network communication, process management, and more. Syscalls are essential for interacting with the underlying hardware and resources of a computer system.
* **APIs**:
    * **Native API**, also known as the **NT API**, is the low-level interface provided by the Windows NT kernel. It is used internally by the operating system and provides direct access to kernel services. The Native API offers a comprehensive set of system functions and data structures, allowing developers to interact at a lower level with the operating system. It is powerful but complex and requires a deep understanding of the underlying system architecture.
        * You can see DLLs for Native APIs like : ntdll.dll or win32u.dll
        * Distinguishable by the NT or ZW prefix
    * **Windows API**, also known as the **WinAPI** or the **Win32 API**, is a higher-level interface built on top of the Native API. It provides a more user-friendly and abstracted programming interface for application developers. The Windows API includes a vast collection of functions and resources that allow programmers to interact with various aspects of the Windows operating system, such as GUI components, file operations, registry access, and more. It encapsulates many common syscalls within higher-level functions, making it easier to develop Windows applications.
        * Officially documented by Microsoft Programming reference for the Win32 API — Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn “MSDN”
        * Exported by different DLL such as user32.dll or kernel32.dll, etc.

The Native API and Windows API differ in four key ways:
* Abstraction: The Native API operates at a low level, directly accessing the Windows kernel and system resources. The Windows API simplifies development with a higher-level interface that hides system complexity.
* Complexity: The Native API is intricate, demanding deep system knowledge for detailed control. The Windows API is more accessible, with a simpler learning curve for broader developer use.
* Portability: The Native API is specific to the Windows NT kernel, limiting its scope. The Windows API ensures compatibility across Windows versions, allowing apps to run without major tweaks.
* Documentation and Support: The Windows API offers extensive documentation, a large community, and robust Microsoft support. The Native API has minimal official documentation and fewer resources.
